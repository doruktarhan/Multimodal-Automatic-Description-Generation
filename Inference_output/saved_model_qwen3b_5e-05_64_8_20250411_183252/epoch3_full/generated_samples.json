All this constitutes a rare opportunity to enjoy peace and quiet in the center of Amsterdam.\n\nKey features:\n- Immediate rental income from stable office lease in the front house, allowing for a phased renovation.\n- Freehold land (no leasehold).\n- Spacious layout: Front house (7.60m wide) & Annex (12.7m wide).\n- Peaceful retreat: 220 m² garden, excluding a 41 m² garden house, offering exceptional privacy.\n- Rich history of the property, with extensive historical documentation available.\n- Original condition of the annex, preserving original 17th-century elements.\n- Limited heritage restrictions on the front house (currently office space), making it likely to be eligible for high-end renovations.\n- Impressive architecture & grand appearance of the building.\n- Prime location on Keizersgracht.\n\nHISTORY\nThe property, built in the 17th century during the construction of the ring of canals, is an example of a typical Amsterdam merchant’s house. The original structure, consisting of a front house, annex house and garden house, reflects the urban and architectural development of the time. \n\nThe facade, in brown brick, shows influences of both Louis XV style (Rococo) and Neoclassicism. Of particular note are the decorative elements such as the attic with reliefs and symbols of commerce and abundance, including a caduceus and trident. The garden house, designed by architect Simon Schijnvoet and decorated by Anthonie Turck, features rich sculptures reflecting the connections of the former owner, Christopher Brants, with Tsar Peter the Great.\n\nThe property has a rich history, with prominent residents such as the Coymans, Deutz and Oyens families. Merchants, bankers and lawyers used the house both as a residence and as a place of business. Christopher Brants played an important role in trade with Russia and founded the “Brants Rus Hofje.” The influential Oyens family transformed parts of the house in the 19th century.\n\nIn the 20th century, the building served as the headquarters of the Amsterdamsche Verzekeringsbank and later as a mixed residential and office space. Since 1981, the current owner has preserved its monumental character through careful restorations.\n\nA major renovation in 1712 aligned both the interior and exterior with the architectural tastes of the time. The dining room in the rear house still retains elements from Hendrik Husly's 1761 renovation, including ornate stucco ceilings and wall coverings in the Louis XV style.\n\nThe monumental value of Keizersgracht 317 lies in the authenticity of the 17th- and 18th-century componentss. Both the exterior and interior, including fireplaces, wall tapestries, and stucco ceilings, are regarded as unique within Amsterdam’s canal district.\n\nRESIDENTIAL\nThe main floor, together with the annex, offers exceptional space and potential for those seeking a one-of-a-kind canal residence.

(including 108 m² g.o. in the souterrain, currently 2m high under the beams, with potential for conversion into living space)\n- Outdoor space: 32 m² (rooftop terrace)\n- Garden house: 41 m²\n\nOFFICE\nThe front house, currently used as office space from the first floor upwards, comprises four floors of workspaces, total 425 m² g.o. These office areas are characterized by elegant design, high ceilings, and large windows, allowing ample natural light.

That's nice!\n\nArea:\nGrote Bickersstraat is a street in the Bickerseiland district of Amsterdam, part of the Western Islands in the city centre. This area, which includes Bickerseiland, Prinseneiland and Realeneiland, was developed between 1611 and 1615 as part of the Third Expansion of Amsterdam, originally serving as an industrial and maritime hub due to its proximity to the IJ riverbank. The street itself runs along the northern edge of Bickerseiland and offers a historical glimpse into Amsterdam's rich maritime past.\n\nThe street is named after Jan Gerritsz. Bicker (1591–1653), a prominent merchant, shipbuilder and member of the influential Bicker family. In 1631, Jan Bicker became the owner of Bickerseiland, where he established shipyards, warehouses and workers' houses to support the flourishing trade of the Dutch West India Company, founded in 1621. Grote Bickersstraat once overlooked busy shipyards and the IJ, reflecting its importance during Amsterdam’s Golden Age. Today, Grote Bickersstraat combines historic charm with modern residential and cultural functions. The street features a mix of restored historic buildings and newer developments. Notable buildings include Grote Bickersstraat 35, a property saved and restored by the preservation organization Stadsherstel Amsterdam. Purchased by Jan Bicker in 1632, this building reflects the area’s shipbuilding heritage, with nearby shipyards such as “De Oranjeboom” and “De Hoop” once lining the IJ bank. Another notable location is Grote Bickersstraat 2-4, a former industrial complex from 1908, originally part of a steam engine factory, later converted into a theater and cultural center by Stichting De Windbreker.\n\nWere we right?

As the gateway and iconic landmark of IJburg, it stands out with its unique location and architectural style. The innovative open design in a square shape features impressive exterior staircases that are accessible to the public during the day and lead to a rooftop promenade with breathtaking views. The building is already attracting the attention of international architecture enthusiasts. Surrounding the Sluishuis is a special water landscape, with islands each serving a unique function, and a 400-meter-long boardwalk with houseboats and moorings for recreational vessels.\nThe sustainability of Sluishuis is an integral part of the project. With an energy performance coefficient (EPC) of -0.01, the building generates more energy than it consumes. The heating demand of the building is minimized by combining excellent insulation techniques, triple glazing, and heat recovery from the ventilation systems and wastewater. Energy consumption is further reduced by using an Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) system in the ground for heating and cooling, in combination with district heating to handle peak demands. The remaining energy consumption for heating, heat pumps, ventilation, and LED lighting is fully offset by approximately 2,200 m² of solar panels, dedicated to a fully floating island next to the project. In developing Sluishuis, significant attention was given to greenery and water management. At the front, sides, and in the inner harbor, gardens with local!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! true plants were created, providing habitat for birds and insects. The water management system ensures that the water level remains stable, even during heavy rainfall. The project also includes a floating garden, a floating playground, and a floating greenhouse. The floating garden is a place for relaxation and recreation, while the floating playground offers a safe space for children. The floating greenhouse is a sustainable way to grow fresh vegetables and herbs, contributing to the local food chain.\n\nThe neighborhood\nIJburg is a vibrant and dynamic neighborhood in Amsterdam, known for its unique architecture and sustainable living.

The complex on Marnixstraat is part of the broader Groenmarkt project and is distinguished by its high-quality architecture and central location. The architects have delivered a nearly energy-neutral building with excellent insulation and solar panels on the roof, contributing to ideal living comfort.\n\nLiving:\nThe private entrance means you don't have to share the front door with neighbors and provides ample space in the ground-floor hallway for a baby carriage or electric bike, in addition to shoes and coats.\nUpon entering the second floor, you immediately notice the beautiful herringbone parquet floor, under which lies the home's underfloor heating. The sitting area faces southeast, allowing plenty of daylight to enter and you can enjoy the sun on the adjacent balcony in the afternoon.\nThe open (Leicht) kitchen with island forms the heart of the living floor and is equipped with modern amenities, such as a Quooker, a wine climate cabinet and a Bora cooktop with integrated extractor fan. Adjacent is the dining area, where the high windows offer stunning views of the Lijnbaansgracht.\n\nOn the second floor is the master bedroom at the rear, with access to a private balcony facing southeast. The long landing, where the parquet floor comes out beautifully, leads to the second and third bedrooms at the front. The spacious bathroom has a bathtub, a walk-in shower and a double sink unit.\n\nParking:\nAccess to the parking garage is through the Groenmarktkade building via the electric garage door. Here you can park your car safely and covered in your own permanent parking space.\nThe parking lot is equipped with an electric charging station for charging electric and hybrid vehicles. This charging station is owned and will remain behind.\n\nLocation:\nLocated on Marnixstraat, adjacent to the Jordaan and close to the Grachtengordel, this property offers an ideal opportunity to enjoy the urban dynamics. Residents benefit from excellent accessibility with streetcar and bus connections within walking distance and a wide range of stores, restaurants and cultural hotspots nearby. The Vondelpark, Museum Quarter and food court de Hallen are a short distance away, offering recreational and leisure opportunities, and the Elandsgracht, the Jordaan's nicest and most versatile shopping street, is within walking distance. The playground in adjacent square is a nice place for children while you can keep an eye on them from the balcony.\n\nHistory:\nMarnixstraat and its surroundings have a rich history. Originally this was the old city limits of Amsterdam, with the fortifications along the Singelgracht. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Marnixstraat developed into an important street with markets, craft businesses and later cultural institutions such as the Melkweg and the old Bellevue Theater. Groenmarkt honors this past by creating a sustainable, contemporary residential environment that blends seamlessly with the city's historical context.\n\nGround lease:\nThe current ground rent for the property is only €1,368.04 per year, and for the parking space €15.23 per year, while the term runs until 30-11-2068.\nA switch to perpetual ground lease under the conditions of 2023 has been applied.\n\nImprovements to Marnixstraat:\nCurrently, Marnixstraat is undergoing a redesign to improve traffic safety and livability. The municipality of Amsterdam is working on wider sidewalks, more green spaces and a better flow of public transport. Parking spaces will be moved to the Singelgracht-Marnix underground garage, creating more space above ground for cyclists and pedestrians. One-way traffic will also be introduced to increase traffic safety. These modifications will make Marnixstraat more attractive and livable for residents and visitors.\n\nWith this combination of convenient location, modern and sustainable construction, historical references and improved infrastructure, this property offers an attractive living and working environment in the heart of Amsterdam.\n\nFeatures:\n- Energy label A++\n- Service costs house € 193,80 per month\n- Service costs parking spot € 45,41 per month\n- Including parking place with charging station\n- Construction year 2021\n- Leasehold fee only € 1.368,04 per year and tax deductible\n- Switch to perpetual leasehold under the conditions of 2023 has been applied\n- Very central location with good roads and public transport connections\n```html\n<div>\n  <h2>Key Features</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Living area: 116 m²</li>\n    <li>Own parking space in the covered parking garage</li>\n    <li>Energy label A++</li>\n    <li>Service costs: € 193,80 per month for the house and € 45,41 per month for the parking space</li>\n    <li>Switch to perpetual leasehold under the conditions of 2023 has been applied</li>\n    <li>Very central location with good roads and public transport connections</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```",

It is a uniquely designed, award-winning building. Elements was not shaped on the drawing board but by combining data in a 3D model. Aspects such as the orbit around the sun, daylight, the effect of wind, and power generation were all taken into account. The resulting building is in balance with the elements, devoid of sharp corners, and with striking bronze-coloured horizontal lines. The contours of the building blend in with the surroundings, creating the optimum living experience. \n\nElements living \nLiving in Elements means living in a building with unprecedented benefits. The 70-metre-high tower will house 70 owner-occupier apartments and 70 middle-sector rented apartments. Elements will have its own swimming pool with a view of the River Amstel. The building will also have several roof gardens. Lovely places to sit back and relax. The ground floor of Elements will accommodate businesses, such as co-working spaces, and a friendly bar. \n\nClimate-positive \nElements is climate-positive in terms of energy: a lot of the building’s energy requirements will be generated sustainably by integrated solar panels in the edges of the balconies. In addition, sustainable wood will be used in the building to reduce the carbon footprint, and the green roof gardens will help to lower heat stress in the city. \n\nAccessibility \nJust five minutes away from the A2 motorway, Amsterdam Amstel mainline station and Spaklerweg metro station. \nThe apartments in Elements are due to be completed in Q2 of 2026.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! young property, no age clause",

    "Haarlemmermeerstraat 49-3": "Modernized and tastefully finished 3/4-room apartment with 2 bedrooms and a fully equipped studio on the top floor, with a private entrance and amenities, in Amsterdam-Zuid!\n\nThis bright 1932 apartment has been carefully and lovingly modernized over the past few years, transforming it into a fantastic, warm living space, located in a cozy part of Haarlemmermeerstraat, the “village neighborhood” of the city!\n\nRecently, the lighting plan in almost all rooms was updated with new spotlights, enhancing the warm atmosphere of this wonderful home. At the same time, the floors were sanded and oiled, giving the apartment an extra luxurious appearance.\n\nTwo years ago, the top-floor studio was built—a perfect space for a live-in child, family member, an au pair, or as an additional rental opportunity. The studio has its own entrance from the central staircase, a private living room, rooftop terrace, kitchen, bathroom, and sleeping loft.\n\nWho is this home ideal for? We believe this property is perfect for:\n- A single person or couple who wants to accommodate a (semi-)independent child or family member with their own entrance and privacy.\n- Expats who regularly welcome visiting family and want to offer them a private living and sleeping area.\n- A couple looking to generate extra income by renting out the top-floor studio.\n- A home worker in search of a luxurious and inspiring ‘home office,’ separate from the main residence but fully equipped.\n\nThe neighborhood:\nHaarlemmermeerstraat is one of the most charming streets in Amsterdam-Zuid. Here, you live in a lively neighborhood with a great mix of shops, cafés, and restaurants. Whether you’re in the mood for a good coffee, a piece of cake, or just a relaxing stroll, Haarlemmermeerstraat always has something to offer. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed—a great place for both residents and visitors to connect.\n\nYou’ll be living just around the corner from the iconic Vondelpark, the green heart of Amsterdam. Living so close to Vondelpark means not only having a piece of nature in the city but also experiencing a little bit of vacation every day!\n\nAdditional Key Benefits:\n- The large inner gardens at the back provide privacy while allowing you to wake up to birdsong.\n- Deally located near major roads—you can reach the A10 ring road within 1-2 minutes.\n- Parking is almost always available right in front with a permit.\n- The perpetual leasehold has been paid off until March 31, 2063.\n- Situated on the third and fourth floors with no upstairs neighbors, ensuring no noise disturbances.\n- The home features a mix of double glazing and HR++ glass and has an energy label C.\n- Air conditioning provides both heating and cooling.\n- The Homeowners’ Association (VvE) has a substantial reserve and a multi-year maintenance plan (MJOP). The monthly service fees are approximately € 182,- and are professionally managed by VvE Beheer Amsterdam.\n\nLayout\n\nMain Residence:\nEntrance with hallway, extended fuse box, modern luxury bathroom with a walk-in shower, toilet, washbasin with storage, and connections for a washing machine and dryer.\nBright and spacious living room with en-suite dining room, separable by characteristic sliding doors.\nTwo bedrooms at the rear (one large and one slightly smaller), both with access to the balcony.\nKitchen with various built-in appliances (including a new Quooker CUBE, dishwasher, refrigerator, freezer, combination microwave, 5-burner cooktop), central heating boiler (2014), and access to the balcony, which features a charming built-in bench storage.\n\nTop-Floor Studio (Renovated 2 Years Ago):\nPrivate entrance via the central staircase.\nLiving room with an open luxury kitchen, equipped with various appliances (induction cooktop, refrigerator, dishwasher, etc.). Two French doors leading to the rooftop terrace (approx. 9 m²).\nBathroom with toilet, sink, and walk-in shower.\nFixed staircase to the sleeping loft, featuring two large skylights for extra natural light.\n\nWith plenty of light, fresh finishes, and a smart layout, this is the perfect home for those who love both comfort and style. And all of this on the top floor—how great is that?\n\nIn short, this home is ideal for anyone looking for extra space and a peaceful, worry-free place to live, with all the comforts of city life within easy reach.\n```md\n**Disclaimer:** \nThis information has been compiled with the utmost care.

    "Dijkmeerlaan 343": "The Robin - Bajeskwartier\n\nFrom prison grounds to a vibrant, green city district for free spirits!\n\nAmsterdam is gaining a new urban district: Bajeskwartier. A place with a rich history, Bajeskwartier is being transformed into a circular, sustainable, and healthy neighborhood. This exceptional location adds something new to Amsterdam: high-density urban living in a green setting, where you can wander through a landscape of around seventy gardens. The prison wall largely remains intact and will soon serve as a plant and climbing wall.\n\nLocation\nBajeskwartier is located within the A10 ring road in the Overamstel area of Amsterdam-East, nestled between Amstelkwartier and the Weespertrekvaart. The area itself or its immediate surroundings offer a variety of restaurants. By bike, you can reach Dam Square in no time. The metro from the nearby Spaklerweg station takes you to Amstel Station in just two minutes. By car, you can access the A10, A2, or A4 in less than five minutes. Everything is close by here: the city center, Zuidas, Science Park, the popular Amstelstrand, or the green expanses of the Amstelscheg.\n\nSustainability\nBajeskwartier is designed to be sustainable, circular, and energy-neutral. The homes are highly insulated. A mobility hub encourages the use of shared transportation: with a convenient app, you can access eco-friendly options like (electric) cargo bikes, e-bikes, scooters, and electric shared cars. The Robin is connected to collective thermal energy systems (WKO) provided by an ESCO partner. Solar panels on the rooftop garden of the ninth floor generate energy for the WKO system. Rainwater is collected on the roofs and under the ground floor to reduce the load on surface water and to irrigate the rooftop gardens.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Robin is a true eye-catcher, designed by the renowned Barcode Architects. Its height is inspired by the original prison tower. At a lower level, a landscape of rooftop gardens surrounds the building, while the base remains open. The design evokes the image of a ballerina. The facades shine golden yellow in the sunlight, but the real treasure lies inside: the six-story-high atrium, a spacious entrance hall with warm red accents that serves as the beating heart of the building. This space is ideal for exhibitions or public events.\n\nShared Rooftop Gardens\nIn addition to private balconies, the fifth, seventh, and ninth floors offer green rooftop gardens and terraces exclusively for residents. These spaces allow you to enjoy the rooftop greenery and the magnificent views in this unique urban setting. The terraces are oriented toward the morning or evening sun, offering breathtaking vistas of Amsterdam.\n\nLandscape\nLiving in Bajeskwartier means being part of a high-quality, semi-public area with approximately 68 gardens. The landscape features abundant greenery and water, accessible to residents via bicycle and pedestrian paths. Cars are absent from the streetscape, directed instead to an underground parking garage. A central pedestrian route, nicknamed the \"Kalverstraat\" of the area, runs through the greenery, connecting all districts. The landscape design, created by Lola Landscape Architects, includes a management association and a maintenance plan.\n\nAmenities\nThe Robin includes a daycare center with a private urban garden where children can play safely outdoors. Additionally, there’s a service center for residents' inquiries. The building also provides access to the Bajeskwartier's underground parking garage, where you can rent a parking space. This is also the hub for shared mobility options.\n\nLAYOUT\n\nGround Floor\nEntrance with intercom panel, mailboxes, and the atrium with its signature staircase leading to the first floor. The elevator and stairs provide access to all floors.\n\nThird Floor\nEntrance with utility closet. Spacious living room with access to a generous balcony facing southwest, offering playful views of the Amstelkwartier. A luxurious Siematic kitchen in an island setup is optional and still to be installed. The design includes a fridge/freezer, a multifunctional oven with steam function, an induction cooktop with extractor, a dishwasher, and a Quooker tap. Siemens appliances are standard, but buyers can customize the design to their preferences.\nThe hallway leads to three well-sized bedrooms, a technical room with a washing machine connection, a fully finished bathroom with Mosa ceramic tiles, Duravit sanitary ware, and Hansgrohe fixtures, and a separate toilet.\nThe apartment is spacious and bright, thanks to floor-to-ceiling doors and windows. Walls are prepared for wallpaper, and the floor is a seamless, shrink-resistant anhydrite base.\n\nBasement\nThe basement includes a private storage unit of approximately 5 m², located on the same

Hardly anything had been done to the house in 60 years, so we renewed almost everything except the facade. It was a big job, but with a lot of pleasure and hard work we really made it our home. The lockdowns brought unexpected benefits: family and friends were ready to help, which not only made the process easier, but also more pleasant. We are still very proud of the result and we hope that the new residents will enjoy it just as much. Every morning starts for us with a coffee and breakfast at the kitchen island, where the sun shines beautifully. By moving the kitchen to the front, we have created a light, spacious kitchen-diner. Our favorite spot? The bay window, where you can look outside at everything that passes by. Thanks to the wide street, you also have no view from the neighbors, and the tree in front of the door provides extra privacy for three quarters of the year.\nAt the weekend, we like to go out. Sometimes to De Pijp, sometimes along the Amstel or one of the parks in the area. We have always experienced the mix of the liveliness of De Pijp and the center, and the quiet, friendly atmosphere of the Rivierenbuurt, as a big plus. Every year we also look forward to De Parade, which takes place literally around the corner in the MLK park. For a cozy evening in the neighborhood, we highly recommend La Maria (a cozy pizzeria) and De Nada (a nice wine bar). But actually, there is nothing better than ending the day on the balcony and enjoying the last rays of sunshine.\n\nLAYOUT\nNeat communal staircase, completely renovated in 2024. The staircase is shared with only one other apartment.\n\nThe entrance to the house is on the second floor. The various rooms can be reached from the hall. The L-shaped living room with open kitchen is located at the front. This room combines unique thirties style features with contemporary living comfort. A bay window from which a nice view of the street, authentic stained glass skylights, natural stone mantelpiece and a very complete kitchen with plenty of cupboard space, marble composite countertop and extensive kitchen appliances. The eye-catcher is the cooking island with bar where the current residents spend a lot of time. The living room has enough space for a sitting area and dining table. In the living room there are various built-in cupboards including a large walk-in closet, accessible from the kitchen, very useful for supplies and storing all kinds of things. There are 2 bedrooms at the rear. The spacious master bedroom has patio doors to the sunny balcony. There is also access to the balcony from the second bedroom. The bathroom is practically furnished with a bath, separate shower with rain shower head and a washbasin with vintage furniture so that the authentic atmosphere is also reflected here. In the hall there is a toilet with hanging closet and marble sink and a storage room with washing machine connection. The sunny balcony at the rear faces west so that you can enjoy the sun in the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe entire house has a herringbone parquet floor with underfloor heating, stucco walls and ceilings. The ceilings have the characteristic thirties skirting board and partly recessed spotlights. The bathroom has electric underfloor heating. The kitchen has a built-in refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher, oven, combination microwave, wine climate cabinet, induction hob with extractor and Quooker so that you have hot and cold water as well as boiling water immediately.\n\nLOCATION\nLocated in Amsterdam South in the Rivierenbuurt.

The house has a nice unobstructed view at the front towards the water. The house is located in the middle of a large area where much has changed in recent years. Many old residential buildings have been demolished and replaced by beautiful varied new construction. Nearby is “the Coal Kit,” an iconic building with a 48-meter tall, sloping tower. The public spaces have also been thought of: there is plenty of greenery and streets have been laid out so that the neighborhood remains as pedestrian as possible. Parking is available in the enclosed courtyard behind the residence.\n\nAMENITIES\nWhether it is sports, shopping, going out, learning or spending your free time: all amenities are within easy reach. For example, walk to The Villy for coffee or breakfast/lunch, to Rahmouni for delicious patisserie, or to Mas Mais for the tastiest tacos. There is an elementary school, after-school care and childcare around the corner. And several gyms and the swimming pool are also within walking distance. There are several (sports) parks in the immediate vicinity and small children can play in the neighborhood to their hearts content: there is a small square with sandpit and there are many playground equipment and little traffic through car-free streets.
