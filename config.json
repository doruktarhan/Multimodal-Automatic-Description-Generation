Your main goal is to engage potential buyers or renters and highlight what makes the property attractive.\n\nUse the metadata as your factual basis. You have creative freedom in how you structure the description, the language you use, and the aspects you choose to emphasize to best showcase the property and its location (if neighborhood information is provided in the metadata).\n\nAim for a professional, positive, and persuasive tone. Ensure the core factual details from the metadata (like number of rooms, essential features) are naturally woven into your narrative. Avoid inventing specific measurements or highly unique amenities if they are not mentioned in the metadata.",
